Q.1. Identify FRs and NFRs:

ANS : 

Functional requirements : 

Authentication system for different class of users such as members / librarian etc.

If a user is not a member and just want to search the LIS no authentication is required.

Only accessible with the institute LAN.

Complete system shut down in case of cyber attack.

Verification email when a user registers for the first time to become a member.

A member can extend date of borrowing if there is no other booking for that book

Librarian can enter a new book record or delete a record using its authorization power.

A non member will not be able to borrow a book using the system.

Library staff can access the system to verify whether the borrowed books are returned on time or not and make appropriate entries in their own books.

A reminder email to members when the due date to return book is approaching.




Non-Functional requirements :

If two or more members are trying to borrow the same book at same time in the system then priority will be given to the first one ie first come first serve(FCFS). 

Locking principles will be employed in the system to avoid deadlocks.

Each process should be processed within 5 seconds

Site loading time should not be more than 2 seconds when number of simultaneous users are greater than > 1000.

Emails should be sent with a latency less than 5 hours.

Institute LAN must be verified when a user accesses the system.

For scalability appropriate power hosting platforms like AWS should be used.

In the frontend instead of vanilla CSS a proper framework like Tailwind should be used as it would enable the site to load faster as there would be no useless CSS.

If not needed, unnecessary animations using javascript and react should be avoided which will improve the system response time.

At times of exams more computing resources should be allocated to the system to avoid any crashes / delay.




















Q.2. Identify scope, features and non-functional aspects of the following problem.



ANS : 


SCOPE : 

The app works in real-time providing alerts to people suffering hearing loss.

App has artificial intelligence integrated in it to recognise the sound appropriately with the current trained model.

App also logs the data it collects so that it can improve further using artificial intelligence.

App is designed to be lightweight and thus has very low latency.

App could have a very large impact on around 466 million people.


 FEATURES:

It has AI inbuilt which can be used to identify appropriate sounds and inform them to the user using various alerting mechanisms.

Its lightweight feature helps the app to be used on older slower smartphones as well.

The app earns through google ads displayed in the bottom part of the screen.

App logs the data so that it can improve continuously and also developers know how to improve the system and improve the efficiency.

Real time alerts help the user to respond to the incoming sound very quickly without any delay.




 NON-FUNCTIONAL ASPECTS:

The app should give an alert within 1-2 seconds to the user so that the user can act accordingly.

Unnecessary animations should be avoided whenever possible to enhance system response time.

Scalability requires the utilization of adequate power hosting platforms, such as AWS.

The model should be trained efficiently so that it takes less time and gives an efficient output.

Appropriate data should be fed to the AI model as the app could sometimes be life saving in some situations.

Appropriate security measures should be deployed in the app.
